graphics:
- sonic wave
- ensure that the mini missile fix is in
- aura should have white smoke, not pixels


- reverse tupolev sprite on bounce
- lower tupolev bomb inertia
- weak acid fan effect for sonic wave?
- lightning gun -> cursed blade / balrog's whip (more dmg, less time)
- spikeball twoshot with fat delay

- unbreak bazooka, but figure out a way to make it not so spammable
- fix sonic wave; experiment with giving it weapon deflection without 
    yeet cannon effect
- rebalance ssg
- slightly nerf mortar
- buff pixel bomb a lot; probably change the entire explosion model
    (instakill with very good aim, but some aoe splash damage)
- maybe give spikeballs one more ammo
- chiquita gun should do a little more damage
- some kind of rb rampage type thing

- omnidirectional repulsor (cf. airmash goliath shield - dunno if there's a good way to do this tho)
- bring back rb rampage in some form, maybe buffed grenade launcher 
    (this could make up for the zimm nerf)
- sword (close-range weapon that does like 40 dmg, 
    to make up for the zimm + spikeballs nerf)
- give missiles bigger and/or more damaging explosions

- thompson vs. minigun: minigun should have better aim, 
    thompson should have higher DPS 
    (SCAR-H vs MAC-10)
